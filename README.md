# github-explorer
GitHub Explorer utilizes the GitHub API to fetch data about repositories based on the user's input and pre-defined filters. The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly and responsive interface. The back-end, implemented with Node.js and Express.js, handles API requests to retrieve data from the GitHub API.
